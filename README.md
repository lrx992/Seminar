- IMPORTANT NOTE: If you want to run this the main.py file, you need to change the directories that are inputted into the plotting functions. Alternatively you can create the same structure as I have:
  - real_data -> kde, eigen, returns, tables, trading, transition_matrix
  - synthetic_iterations -> laplace, normal

Contents:
- Seminar_Volatility_Clustering_Final.pdf (paper hand-in)
- real_data (code output)
- synthetic_iterations (code output)
- 'GAI declaration lrx992.pdf' (declaration of GAI usage)

Code:
- main.py (anlyses used in paper)
- my_function.py (functions used)
